Python Code of the Kalman Filter
We have chosen to divide the Kalman Filtering Code in two parts similarly to its
mathematical theory. The code is simple and divided in three functions with matrix
input and output.
II.1. Prediction Step
This step has to predict the mean X and the covariance P of the system state at the
time step k . The Python function kf_predict performs the prediction of these
output ( X and P ) when giving six input:
X : The mean state estimate of the previous step ( k 1).
P : The state covariance of previous step ( k 1).
A : The transition n ´n matrix.
Q: The process noise covariance matrix.
B : The input effect matrix.
U : The control input.
The Python code of this step is given by:
"""

from numpy import dot
def kf_predict(X, P, A, Q, B, U):
X = dot(A, X) + dot(B, U)
P = dot(A, dot(P, A.T)) + Q
return(X,P)
